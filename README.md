# Haberman-Cancer-Analysis-And-ML Prediction-Model
Haberman’s Cancer Survival: Visual Exploratory Data Analysis using Python (SeaBorn ,Matplotlib)<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the series of asking questions and applying statistics and visualization techniques to answer those questions and to uncover the hidden insights from the data. A case study on the cancer survival data set is done to explore the most common EDA techniques in this Repository.<br><br>
Machine Learning model is build by implementing SVM algorithm through Scikit learn and various accuracy scores such as F1 Score, Jaccard Score are calculated and Confusion Matrix is build. 

<h2>Data Description : </h2>
The Haberman’s survival data set contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.<br><br>
Attribute Information:<br>
1.Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)<br>
2.Patient’s year of operation (numerical)<br>
3.Number of positive auxillary nodes detected (numerical)<br>
4.Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived  2 = the patient died<br>
